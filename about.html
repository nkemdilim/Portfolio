  HEY GIRLS,
  My name is Ariana Nkemdilim Emokah and I am the CEO of Kemdilim. I started this business based on the need of self-fulfilment.
  Growing up I had an fascination in beauty products and worked on different types of skin. This lead to me finding
  out what I wanted to do with my life. As years passed on I grew fond of the Spa and although I never visited one I loved
  Soaking my feet and doing facials with my mom at home. As I grew more my love for nails and lipgloss grew like a shadow.
  I told myself I was going to open my own spa that incorporated everything from body massages to getting your nails done.
  Now I turned 15 and decided that I was going to put my ideas to reality.
